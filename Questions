What is the number of lines of output as a function of n? Explain how you computed it.

Writing out the numbers, we find that when increasing that it is factorial to the number of permutations. So the total number of combinations for
Something like 4 would be 4! Or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4, which would be 24.

Based on your timing results and on an approximation of the number of lines printed, please estimate how long your program would run for n = 15 and for n = 20.
Show how you have computed the estimate.

Running the results for 5 and 10 we get: 27ms runtime for 5 and 228904ms for 10.

If we divide each by their number of permutations (27ms / 5! And 228904ms /10!)
P = n! # The number of permutations of a given integer

27ms / p(5) = .225ms per p
228904ms / p(10) = .063ms per p

(.063ms/per p)+(.225ms/per p)/2(the amount of sum) = .144ms/ per p


Hp = the highest permutation that we can realistically run

Although this would give an average run for permutations, the issue with this is that, as n grows, the amount of time per permutation decreases.
For a more accurate evaluation of time for higher factorials, we would want to use something like { (p(hp)/hp) * n!  where hp = 10

So, for the two factorials where n = 15,20

[Functions to find time in ms]

- t(n = 15, hp = 10) = ((p(10)/10!) * 15!)

Result : 82,383,485,184ms = 22,884hrs = 953.5days = 2.61 years

- t(n = 20, hp = 10) = ((p(10)/10!) * 20!)
Result : 153,272,826,515,128,320ms = 42,575,785,131hrs = 1,773,991,047.1days = 4,856,922.78467years
