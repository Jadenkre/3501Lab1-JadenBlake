What is the number of lines of output as a function of n? Explain how you computed it.

Writing out the numbers we find that when increasing that it is factorial to the number of permutations. So the total number of combinations for
something like 4 would be 4! or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 which would be 24.


Based on your timing results and on approximation of the number of lines printed please estimate how long your program would run for n = 15 and for n = 20. Show how you have computed the estimate.
