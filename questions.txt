What is the number of lines of output as a function of n? Explain how you computed it.

Writing out the numbers we find that when increasing that it is factorial to the number of permutations. So the total number of combinations for
something like 4 would be 4! or 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 which would be 24.


Based on your timing results and on approximation of the number of lines printed please estimate how long your program would run for n = 15 and for n = 20. Show how you have computed the estimate.
Running the results for 5 and 10 we get: 27ms runtime for 5 and 228904ms for 10.
if we divide each by their number of permutations (5! / 27 and 10! / 228904)
4.444 for 5,
7.58 for 6, +3.14
14 for 7, +6.42
16.87 for 8, +2.87
17.87 for 9, +1
20.87 for 10 +3
averaging these values give us a result of 16.33 so we can take this average and times it
by the factorial of our given permutations
so 15! would be around 22243.899 hours
and 20! would be around 4724238.61581 years...
